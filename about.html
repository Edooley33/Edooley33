        When I'm not helping teams be productive while maintaing a fullfilling work-life balance,
        I'm doing the following things.
      </h1>DOGS
      <p>I enjoy anything related to animals, especially dogs. I own two dogs.  One is my mischevious Siberian Husky, Princess. My secon is a bischon Maltese mix, Copper.
        I love seeing my dogs happy, they are my children.  They are loyal to me, obey and listen to me.  My Husky even talks to me since Huskies are known for their howling and talking skills.
        They greet me everytime I come home with so much excitement and love that it seems that they have not seen me in months.  That is the highlight of my day.  I believe there are dog owners and dog lovers
        in this world, and I am a definitely a dog lover.  I enjoy taking them for walks, hikes and their real favorite is the dog park.  Princess is the fastest dog I have ever seen, she can out run any dog at the park.

    <p>I really enjoy couponing to save money while shopping.  I use numerous couponing apps such as: Ibotta, Coupons,Brandclub, Rakuten, Steady just to name a few.
        I think it is thrilling to see the price drop at a checkout whether in a grocery store, pharmacy or online shopping. I have even been asked if I was on the Extreme Couponing show
    since I have a binder of paper coupons.  During these economic times, I feel every penny counts.  I am organized and always search out a deal before making a purchase. I search many stores to get the most cash back for my purchases.

<p> I have always enjoyed movies ever since a child.  I used to watch them on VHS tapes as a kid.  I went to the movie theater every week as a teenager.  Now I use
    multiple streaming services to watch movies.  I enjoy all different types of movies, my favorites are: Drama, Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action, Adventure, Crime 
    Dramas, and Documentaries. I am a big fan of the classics such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones.
